### Data

The information is ditributed in the next .CSV files: 
  - `bee_interactions` A table containing the interactions between bee and plant individuals during the summer of 2014.
  - `BeeTraits` Contains data on each bee species, detailing the average intertegular distances, average bee size, and species abundance.
  - `PlantTraits` Includes data on each plant species, detailing the average height (from ground level to canopy), the average number of flowers per stem, and the average width of the flower head.
  

### Code

The script `funktionen.R` includes functions to generate the degree and strength dynamics of the network assembly.
